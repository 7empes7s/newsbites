# NewsBites Leveling Plan V1
# The Intelligence Layer — 6-Month Roadmap

**Created:** 2026-04-13  
**Owner:** Marouane Defili  
**Execution:** Claude Code + Codex CLI  
**Target app:** `news.techinsiderbytes.com` — currently in dev, no security hardening until explicitly requested  
**Cadence:** 2 phases per week × 26 weeks = 52 phases  
**Start date:** 2026-04-14 (Week 1)  
**End date:** 2026-10-12 (Week 26)

## Vision

Every article becomes a **living intelligence card**. Alongside the prose, contextual live data appears automatically based on what the article is about — football standings when covering a match, a stock chart when covering a company, a launch countdown when covering a space mission. The reader doesn't need to open another tab. The article becomes the whole picture.

On **desktop**: a fixed right-column panel (320px) sits alongside the article body.  
On **mobile**: a drawer anchored to the bottom of the screen, collapsed by default, with a visible tab/handle the reader taps or swipes up to expand.

This is the same spirit as the Finance intelligence layer already built (`/finance` dashboard with live market data + AI signals) — but applied universally, article by article, vertical by vertical.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Free APIs first.** Never add a paid API dependency without a confirmed free tier that covers our volume.
2. **Server components fetch, client components interact.** Data fetching stays in RSC / `generateStaticParams` / ISR. Panels are only interactive on the client after hydration.
3. **Graceful degradation.** If a data source is down or rate-limited, the panel hides silently. The article is always primary.
4. **No speculation.** Don't build panels for verticals that have no articles yet. Build when content exists.
5. **One canonical panel system.** All verticals use the same `ArticleIntelPanel` shell. No bespoke per-page hacks.
6. **Editorial AI produces hints.** Over time, the Writer agent outputs `panel_hints` in frontmatter, giving the panel system pre-detected signals (tickers, teams, competition IDs, country codes).
7. **Dev-only for now.** No auth, no rate-limit middleware, no CSP headers. That gate comes when Marouane says so.

### Article page layout change

Current: `max-w-3xl mx-auto` centered column.  
New (lg+): `grid grid-cols-[1fr_320px] gap-8` — article left, panel right.  
Mobile: article full-width, panel as bottom drawer.

### `PanelConfig` type

```typescript
interface PanelConfig {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  icon: LucideIcon;
  Component: React.ComponentType<PanelSectionProps>;
  fetchData: (article: Article) => Promise<unknown>;
  revalidate: number;   // ISR seconds
  priority: number;     // lower = shown first in drawer tab order
}
```

### Panel registry logic

```typescript
// lib/panels/registry.ts
export function getPanelSections(article: Article): PanelConfig[] {
  const configs: PanelConfig[] = [];
  const { vertical, tags, panel_hints } = article;

  if (vertical === 'sports' || tags?.includes('football')) configs.push(...sportsPanels);
  if (['finance','economy','crypto'].includes(vertical))   configs.push(...financePanels);
  if (['global-politics','world'].includes(vertical))      configs.push(...worldPanels);
  if (['ai','trends','cybersecurity'].includes(vertical))  configs.push(...techPanels);
  if (['space','science'].includes(vertical))              configs.push(...sciencePanels);
  if (['healthcare','tcm','skincare'].includes(vertical))  configs.push(...wellnessPanels);
  if (['climate','energy'].includes(vertical))             configs.push(...climatePanels);
  if (['anime','gaming','culture'].includes(vertical))     configs.push(...culturePanels);

  return configs.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
}
```

### `panel_hints` frontmatter extension

```yaml
panel_hints:
  competition: "CL"          # football-data.org competition code
  teams: ["Arsenal", "Bayern Munich"]
  tickers: ["AAPL", "NVDA"]
  country_codes: ["IR", "US"]
  github_repos: ["openai/openai-python"]
  nasa_mission: "Artemis II"
```

## The 52-Phase Plan

---

### WEEK 1 — Panel Infrastructure Foundation
**Goal:** Build the universal panel shell before any vertical content.

#### Phase 1 — ArticleIntelPanel Shell
- Build `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`
  - Desktop: renders as fixed right column (320px) within article layout
  - Mobile: renders nothing (panel is a drawer)
- Build `components/article-panel/PanelDrawer.tsx`
  - Mobile-only bottom drawer, anchored to screen bottom
  - Default state: collapsed (shows 48px tall tab strip with section count badge)
  - Expanded state: slides up to 75vh, scrollable content inside
  - CSS-only transition initially (`transform: translateY`, `transition: 0.3s ease`)
  - `open` state managed in article page client wrapper
- Modify article page layout: `app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx` → wrap in 2-col grid on lg
- Files: `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`, `components/article-panel/PanelDrawer.tsx`, `app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/articles/[slug]/layout.tsx` (if needed)

#### Phase 2 — Panel Registry + Type System
- Create `lib/panels/types.ts` — `PanelConfig`, `PanelSectionProps` interfaces
- Create `lib/panels/registry.ts` — `getPanelSections(article)` function, initially empty (returns `[]`)
- Add `panel_hints` to `Article` type in `lib/articles.ts` (optional field, parsed from frontmatter)
- Add `PanelTabBar.tsx`, `PanelSkeleton.tsx` placeholder components
- Validate: article pages still render correctly with empty panel (no regressions)
- Files: `lib/panels/types.ts`, `lib/panels/registry.ts`, `lib/articles.ts`, `components/article-panel/PanelTabBar.tsx`, `components/article-panel/PanelSkeleton.tsx`

---

### WEEK 2 — Sports Foundation
**Goal:** Champions League article gets live data. First fully working panel vertical.

#### Phase 3 — Football Data Fetcher
- Create `lib/panels/fetchers/sports.ts`
  - `fetchStandings(competitionCode: string)` → football-data.org `/v4/competitions/{code}/standings`
  - `fetchLiveMatches(competitionCode: string)` → `/v4/competitions/{code}/matches?status=LIVE`
  - `fetchUpcomingFixtures(competitionCode: string, teamNames?: string[])` → `/v4/competitions/{code}/matches?status=SCHEDULED`
  - `fetchTeamForm(teamId: number, last: number)` → `/v4/teams/{id}/matches?limit={last}`
  - Respect 10 req/min limit: use `revalidate: 300` on standings, `revalidate: 60` on live
  - Detect competition from `panel_hints.competition` OR tag-based heuristics (tags include `champions-league` → `CL`, `premier-league` → `PL`, etc.)
- Add `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and `next.config.js` server env
- Files: `lib/panels/fetchers/sports.ts`, `.env.local`, `next.config.js`

#### Phase 4 — Standings + Fixtures Panel Components
- Create `components/panels/sports/StandingsTable.tsx`
  - Compact table: rank, team crest (img), team name, P W D L GD Pts
  - Highlight teams mentioned in `panel_hints.teams` with amber border
  - "Show full table" expand toggle
- Create `components/panels/sports/FixturesCard.tsx`
  - List of upcoming matches: date, home vs away, competition round
  - Live match: shows score with pulsing indicator
- Register `sportsPanels` in `lib/panels/registry.ts`
- Update `champions-league-quarterfinals-*.md` with `panel_hints.competition: "CL"` + `panel_hints.teams`
- Validate: Champions League article renders standings and fixtures in panel
- Files: `components/panels/sports/StandingsTable.tsx`, `components/panels/sports/FixturesCard.tsx`, `lib/panels/registry.ts`, article frontmatter

---

### WEEK 3 — Sports Intelligence: Pronostics
**Goal:** Panel becomes predictive, not just informational.

#### Phase 5 — Pronostics Engine
- Create `lib/panels/pronostics.ts`
  - Input: team A form (last 5), team B form (last 5), H2H record (last 10), venue (home/neutral/away)
  - Form score: W=3, D=1, L=0 weighted by recency (most recent × 1.5)
  - H2H adjustment: each win in H2H for team A adds 0.1 to A's weight
  - Home advantage: +0.15 multiplier for home team
  - Output: `{ homeWin: number, draw: number, awayWin: number }` (sums to 1.0)
  - Also outputs: predicted score range, "likely BTTS" flag (both teams to score), "over 2.5 goals" flag
- Create `components/panels/sports/PronosticWidget.tsx`
  - Three probability bars (home / draw / away) with percentages
  - Predicted outcome badge: "ARSENAL WIN" / "DRAW" with confidence label (high/medium/low)

- Create `components/panels/climate/RenewableCapacityCard.tsx`
  - Global installed capacity for solar/wind/hydro
  - Country-specific data if country is mentioned in article
  - YoY growth rate highlighted
- Files: `components/panels/climate/RenewableCapacityCard.tsx`, `content/panels/renewable-capacity.json`

---

### WEEK 14 — Culture/Anime Panel
**Goal:** Anime and culture articles feel like a fan hub.

#### Phase 27 — Anime Season Chart
- Create `lib/panels/fetchers/culture.ts`
  - `fetchCurrentSeasonAnime()` → Jikan v4 `/seasons/now` — top airing titles
  - `fetchAnimeDetails(malId: number)` → Jikan `/anime/{id}`
  - Anime detection: article tags → MAL title search
- Create `components/panels/culture/AniSeasonCard.tsx`
  - Current season chart: top 5 airing shows with score, episode count, genre tags
  - Mentioned anime highlighted with amber border
  - Next episode countdown for airing shows
- Register for `anime` vertical
- Files: `lib/panels/fetchers/culture.ts`, `components/panels/culture/AniSeasonCard.tsx`

#### Phase 28 — AniList Rich Panel
- AniList GraphQL (free, 90 req/min) provides richer data than Jikan
  - Studio info, source material, streaming platforms, trailer embed (YouTube)
- Create `components/panels/culture/AnilistProfileCard.tsx`
  - Full show card: cover art, synopsis snippet, status (RELEASING/FINISHED), score, streaming links
  - Season/year context
- Files: `components/panels/culture/AnilistProfileCard.tsx`

---

### WEEK 15 — Gaming Panel
**Goal:** Gaming articles come with a mini store page.

#### Phase 29 — RAWG Game Profile Card
- Create `lib/panels/fetchers/culture.ts` additions
  - `fetchGameDetails(gameName: string)` → RAWG `/games/{slug}` or search
  - Returns: Metacritic score, release date, platforms, genres, ESRB, screenshots
- Create `components/panels/culture/GameProfileCard.tsx`
  - Cover art (from RAWG), title, score badges (Metacritic + user), platforms row
  - Release date + "X days until release" if upcoming
  - Genre/tag chips
- Add `RAWG_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
- Register for `gaming` vertical
- Files: `components/panels/culture/GameProfileCard.tsx`

#### Phase 30 — Release Calendar
- `fetchUpcomingGames(query: string)` → RAWG with date range filter
- Create `components/panels/culture/ReleasesCalendarCard.tsx`
  - List of upcoming game releases in the same genre/platform as article's game
  - "Coming this month / this quarter"
- Also: box office data for `culture` articles via TMDB `/trending/movie/week` (free)
- Create `components/panels/culture/BoxOfficeCard.tsx`
- Files: `components/panels/culture/ReleasesCalendarCard.tsx`, `components/panels/culture/BoxOfficeCard.tsx`

---

### WEEK 16 — Trends Panel
**Goal:** Trends articles show the actual virality data.

#### Phase 31 — Google Trends Integration
- Google Trends has no official API, but `pytrends` (Python) or the unofficial JS `google-trends-api` package work
- Build a small Node.js serverless function (`app/api/trends/route.ts`) that:
  - Accepts a keyword, calls `google-trends-api`, returns 7-day interest-over-time data
  - Caches result in-memory (or `content/panels/trends-cache/`) for 1 hour
- Create `components/panels/trends/GoogleTrendsSparkline.tsx`
  - Mini line chart showing 7-day trend for article's primary keyword
  - "Interest over time" label + current relative score
- Register for `trends` vertical
- Files: `app/api/trends/route.ts`, `components/panels/trends/GoogleTrendsSparkline.tsx`

#### Phase 32 — Reddit Sentiment Meter
- Reddit API free tier (60 req/min with app credentials)
- `app/api/reddit/route.ts` — search for article topic in relevant subreddits
  - Returns: top 3 posts (title, upvotes, comment count, sentiment)
- Create `components/panels/trends/RedditSentimentCard.tsx`
  - Sentiment meter: Positive / Neutral / Negative (keyword-based simple scoring)
  - Top thread previews with upvote counts
  - "Discussion is [heating up / cooling down] based on activity"
- Files: `app/api/reddit/route.ts`, `components/panels/trends/RedditSentimentCard.tsx`

---

### WEEK 17 — Mobile Panel UX Polish
**Goal:** The mobile experience is buttery. Not an afterthought.

#### Phase 33 — Smooth Gesture Drawer
- Upgrade `PanelDrawer.tsx` from CSS-only to pointer-event gesture handling
  - `onPointerDown` → track drag delta → `transform: translateY()`
  - Snap to two states: collapsed (48px visible) or expanded (75vh)
  - Velocity-based snap: flick up → expand, flick down → collapse
  - Background overlay (semi-transparent) when expanded
- Drawer peek shows: icon row of available panel sections (e.g. ⚽ standings, 📊 pronostic)
- Haptic feedback hint: animate tab bar badge when panel data loads
- Files: `components/article-panel/PanelDrawer.tsx` (upgrade)

#### Phase 34 — Panel Tab Bar + Multi-Section Navigation
- Upgrade `PanelTabBar.tsx`
  - Horizontal scrollable tab bar when panel has > 2 sections
  - Active tab indicator (amber underline)
  - Tab icons + short labels (e.g., "Standings", "Pronostic", "Fixtures")
  - Badge with section count on the drawer handle
- Keyboard navigation for desktop (arrow keys between tabs)
- URL hash state: `#panel-standings` — so panel tab state is shareable in a link
- Files: `components/article-panel/PanelTabBar.tsx` (upgrade), `PanelDrawer.tsx`

---

### WEEK 18 — Reader App Integration (/app)
**Goal:** Panels work in Focus and Flow modes too.

#### Phase 35 — Focus Mode Panel Integration
- In `components/news-app-shell.tsx` Focus mode: add an "Intelligence" button below each article card
  - Tapping the button expands a panel inline below the card (not a drawer — it's already mobile-first)
  - Panel data is lazy-loaded on first open (don't fetch until user expands)
  - Collapse animation mirrors the article drawer
- Server-side: `getAllArticles()` returns `panel_hints`, pass through to `AppArticle` type
- Files: `components/news-app-shell.tsx`, `lib/articles.ts`

#### Phase 36 — Flow Mode Panel Integration
- In Flow mode (TikTok-style snap): a small tab strip visible at bottom-left of each card
  - "📊 Intelligence" pill — tapping opens a half-sheet overlay on top of the Flow card
  - Overlay closes on swipe down (consistent with Flow's vertical swipe gesture)
  - Panel sections in Flow mode: max 2 (most important only — e.g. Pronostic + Standings for sports)
- Files: `components/news-app-shell.tsx`

---

### WEEK 19 — Editorial AI Pipeline Updates
**Goal:** Articles auto-arrive with panel hints. No manual frontmatter editing.

#### Phase 37 — Writer Agent panel_hints Output
- Update `Writer` agent prompt in `/opt/mimoun/openclaw-config/workspace/newsbites_editorial/prompts/small-model/`
  - After article draft, Writer must produce a `PANEL_HINTS:` block:
    ```
    PANEL_HINTS:
    competition: <football-data.org code if sports/football>
    teams: <comma-separated team names if sports>
    tickers: <stock tickers if finance>
    country_codes: <ISO-3166 codes for countries mentioned>
    github_repos: <owner/repo if tech>
    ```
  - Update `Publisher Desk` agent to parse this block and inject it into article frontmatter
- Files: relevant prompt files in `prompts/small-model/`, `scripts/validate-story-package.mjs`

#### Phase 38 — Panel Cache Warming at Publish Time
- Create `scripts/warm-panel-cache.mjs`
  - Reads a published article's frontmatter + `panel_hints`
  - Pre-fetches panel data (standings, country profile, etc.) and writes to `content/panels/cache/[slug].json`
  - Called by `Publisher Desk` after article is approved
- Next.js pages read from cache file first, fall back to live API
- This solves cold-start latency: first reader after publish sees pre-warmed data
- Files: `scripts/warm-panel-cache.mjs`, adapt panel fetchers to check cache first

---

### WEEK 20 — Pronostics Engine V2
**Goal:** Pronostics become the most cited feature.

#### Phase 39 — Injury/Suspension Signals
- TheSportsDB free API provides squad information
- Add `fetchTeamInjuries(teamId: number)` — TheSportsDB `/api/v1/json/3/searchplayers.php`
- Pronostics engine V2:
  - If key player injured/suspended: reduce that team's attack/defense weight
  - Key player = player with most goals or assists in last 5 matches
  - Show injury disclaimer in PronosticWidget: "Note: [Player] is suspended"
- Files: update `lib/panels/pronostics.ts`, `components/panels/sports/PronosticWidget.tsx`

#### Phase 40 — NBA + F1 Pronostics
- **NBA** (balldontlie.io, free with key):
  - Standings, team stats, recent game results
  - Pronostic: win probability based on Elo rating + home court + recent form
  - Create `components/panels/sports/NBAStandingsCard.tsx`, extend pronostics engine
- **F1** (OpenF1 free API or Ergast):
  - Current standings (drivers + constructors)
  - Next race schedule, circuit info
  - "Expected podium" based on constructor pace + qualifying position
  - Create `components/panels/sports/F1RaceCard.tsx`
- Tag detection: `formula-1`, `f1` → F1 panels; `nba`, `basketball` → NBA panels
- Files: `components/panels/sports/NBAStandingsCard.tsx`, `components/panels/sports/F1RaceCard.tsx`

---

### WEEK 21 — Finance Embedding + CTA Framework
**Goal:** Articles convert readers to the Finance dashboard. Establish the CTA pattern.

#### Phase 41 — Inline Article Finance Embed
- For finance/economy articles: after every article body, auto-inject a "Market Context" block
  - Full-width section (not in panel, embedded IN the article): relevant tickers, their performance since article date, "how did the market react?"
  - Server-rendered via RSC, ISR `revalidate: 300`
- This is the "article has a trading floor below it" moment
- Create `components/ArticleMarketContext.tsx`
  - Shows detected tickers with sparkline + % change since article publish date
  - "The day this article ran, [TICKER] moved X%"
- Files: `components/ArticleMarketContext.tsx`, `app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`

#### Phase 42 — Universal CTA Framework
- Each panel section can emit a `cta` config: `{ label: string, href: string, icon: LucideIcon }`
- Panel footer in `ArticleIntelPanel.tsx` renders a "Go deeper →" CTA button
  - Sports: "Full match coverage →" → future `/sports/[competition]`
  - Finance: "Finance Intelligence →" → `/finance`
  - World: "Regional briefing →" → future `/world/[region]`
  - Tech: "AI tracker →" → future `/tech/ai-tracker`
- This pattern seeds all future group dashboards
- Files: `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`, all panel config objects

---

### WEEK 22 — Sports Dashboard
**Goal:** `/sports` becomes the second full group dashboard after `/finance`.

#### Phase 43 — /sports Landing Page
- Create `app/sports/layout.tsx` + `app/sports/page.tsx`
  - Mirror `/finance` structure: hero section, live scores grid, standings snapshot, recent results
  - Live scores via football-data.org + TheSportsDB
  - "Today's matches" section — all major competitions
  - Top pronostics for today's matches (autogenerated by pronostics engine)
- Create `app/sports/page.tsx` as server component with `revalidate: 60`
- Files: `app/sports/layout.tsx`, `app/sports/page.tsx`

#### Phase 44 — /sports/[competition] Pages
- Create `app/sports/[competition]/page.tsx`
  - Full standings table for the competition
  - Last 5 matchday results with scores
  - Upcoming schedule (next 10 matches)
  - Top scorers table
  - Link back to all articles tagged with that competition
- Generate static routes for supported competitions: `CL`, `PL`, `PD`, `SA`, `BL1`
- Files: `app/sports/[competition]/page.tsx`

---

### WEEK 23 — Panel Performance Audit
**Goal:** No panel ever blocks article render. Data freshness is correct.

#### Phase 45 — ISR Strategy Review
- Audit every panel fetcher's `revalidate` value (see table in ISR section above)
- For panels that use external APIs with strict rate limits (football-data.org: 10/min):
  - Add in-memory request coalescing in `lib/panels/fetchers/sports.ts`
  - Multiple concurrent requests for same competition → single API call + shared result
- Add `Suspense` boundaries around every panel section:
  - Panel section that's loading: shows `PanelSkeleton.tsx`
  - Panel section that errored: shows nothing (silent, article is primary)
- Files: all panel fetchers, `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`

#### Phase 46 — Error Boundaries + Skeleton States
- `PanelErrorBoundary.tsx`: catches render errors in any panel section, renders nothing
- `PanelSkeleton.tsx`: animated pulse skeleton matching the shape of each panel type
  - Standings skeleton: 5 rows of grey bars
  - Market card skeleton: 2 lines + a sparkline area
  - Pronostic skeleton: 3 probability bars
- Test all panels with API offline (mock 500 response): confirm articles remain intact
- Files: `components/article-panel/PanelErrorBoundary.tsx`, `PanelSkeleton.tsx`

---

### WEEK 24 — Cross-Vertical Intelligence
**Goal:** Panels can combine signals from multiple verticals.

#### Phase 47 — Cross-Vertical Panel Injection
- An AI article that mentions NVIDIA stock → shows BOTH the Tech panel AND a finance mini-panel
- A sports article about a club acquisition → shows BOTH sports panel AND finance ticker panel
- Implement in `lib/panels/registry.ts`: cross-vertical signal detection
  - If `panel_hints.tickers` present AND vertical is NOT finance → add compact `TickerSparklineCard` as secondary section
  - If `panel_hints.github_repos` present AND vertical is NOT tech → add compact `GithubRepoCard`
- Files: `lib/panels/registry.ts`

#### Phase 48 — Tag-Based Panel Override
- Panel injection by tag regardless of vertical
  - `tags: ["champions-league"]` → loads CL panel even if article is tagged `world` or `finance`
  - `tags: ["bitcoin", "btc"]` → loads crypto panel even if vertical is `trends`
  - `tags: ["nasa", "spacex", "launch"]` → loads launch tracker
- This means sports/finance/science panels appear anywhere relevant, not locked to their vertical
- Create canonical tag → panel mapping in `lib/panels/registry.ts`
- Files: `lib/panels/registry.ts`

---

### WEEK 25 — Personalization Foundation
**Goal:** The app remembers what the reader cares about.

#### Phase 49 — localStorage Panel Preferences
- Panel state stored in `localStorage` under `newsbites-panel-prefs`:
  ```json
  {
    "defaultExpanded": true,
    "hiddenSections": ["GoogleTrends"],
    "pinnedTab": { "sports": "pronostic" }
  }
  ```
- `PanelTabBar` reads prefs to restore last-viewed tab
- Settings toggle in panel header: "Hide this section" per section
- `PanelDrawer` reads `defaultExpanded` to decide initial state
- Files: `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`, `components/article-panel/PanelTabBar.tsx`

#### Phase 50 — Vertical + Team Subscriptions (localStorage)
- `newsbites-subscriptions` localStorage key:
  ```json
  {
    "teams": ["Arsenal", "Bayern Munich"],
    "verticals": ["ai", "sports"],
    "tickers": ["NVDA", "AAPL"]
  }
  ```
- Panel personalization: subscribed teams get expanded by default and highlighted in standings
- Subscribed tickers: always show in finance panel even if not mentioned in article
- Favorite verticals: `/app` reader pre-filters to these by default
- No backend, no auth — pure client-side for now
- Files: new `lib/subscriptions.ts`, `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`, `components/news-app-shell.tsx`

---

### WEEK 26 — Polish, Connectivity, Master Audit
**Goal:** Everything works. Everything is discoverable. Plan V2 can begin.

#### Phase 51 — Panel Deep Links
- Panel state encoded in URL: `?panel=pronostic` → opens panel with that tab active on load
- Share button in panel header: copies current URL with panel state
  - "Share this analysis →" — copies URL with `?panel=pronostic#article-panel`
- Panel CTA links from Mimule Telegram bot: when Mimule sends an article link, it can append `?panel=standings` to deep-link to the relevant panel
- Files: `components/article-panel/ArticleIntelPanel.tsx`, `PanelTabBar.tsx`

#### Phase 52 — Full Editorial Audit + V2 Scoping
- Run through all 20 existing articles: add `panel_hints` frontmatter where missing
- Verify every panel that should render does render (Champions League → sports, finance articles → tickers, etc.)
- Fix any broken fetchers found during audit
- Document which free APIs are hitting limits and need upgrade or caching strategy
- Write `NEWSBITES_LEVELING_PLAN_V2.md`:
  - Security hardening phase (when Marouane says so)
  - Backend personalization (move subscriptions from localStorage to DB)
  - /world, /tech, /science group dashboards (parallel to /finance and /sports)
  - Mobile app (React Native or PWA with install prompt)
  - Mimule integration: bot can query panel data and send Telegram briefings from it

---

## Preparation Checklist (Before Phase 1)

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| football-data.org free tier too restrictive (10 req/min) | Medium | Aggressive ISR caching (300s standings), never poll on client side |
| Yahoo Finance unofficial API breaks | Medium | Fallback to Alpha Vantage (25/day) for article-time data, FRED for macro |
| Google Trends unofficial library breaks | High | Fallback to static "trending topics" from editorial pipeline, remove panel section gracefully |
| Article layout 2-col breaks mobile | Low | Progressive enhancement — panel is always secondary, mobile layout never changes |
| Launch Library 2 / ISS APIs down | Low | Both have alternatives (SpaceX API, wheretheiss.at) |
| Panel data slows article page load | Medium | Suspense boundaries + skeleton + ISR means panel is never on critical path |
| New Next.js 16 breaking changes in layouts | Medium | Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching layouts |
